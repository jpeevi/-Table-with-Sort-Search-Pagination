When I start a PHP project from scratch to visualize data in a tabular format, I find it hectic to manage sorting, searching, and pagination on the frontend. Writing JavaScript and CSS can be pretty tiring and a bit of a drag. So, I created this template to make life easier! 🚀

This project is a **simple, interactive table template** that lets you manage and display large datasets with ease. The backend is rendered with **PHP**, and the frontend functionalities like sorting, searching, filtering, and pagination are powered by **vanilla JavaScript**. It’s built with **Bootstrap** to keep the styling clean and responsive. All actions manage state even after refresh. 

Please note that the backend PHP code is only for rendering the table. You'll need to implement the sorting, filtering, and searching logic.

### ✨ Features:
- **Sorting**: Sort your table by column with a simple click.
- **Searching**: Quickly filter through the data with a search bar.
- **Filters**: Quickly filter through the data with dropdown filters.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large datasets with pagination controls.
- **Lightweight & Simple**: No complex libraries—just good ol' PHP and vanilla JS!

### 🛠️ Why I Created This Template

When working with PHP projects to display data in tables, managing the frontend features like sorting, search, and pagination always felt like a chore. Writing JavaScript and CSS isn’t exactly my favorite pastime 😅. So, I decided to create this template to streamline the process and make it easier for myself (and anyone else!) to implement these features quickly. It’s simple, clean, and easy to use.
